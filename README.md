# Library System - JavaFX + JDBC

A desktop application built with JavaFX and JDBC to help library administrators efficiently manage book records. The system allows users to perform essential operations such as:

- 📚 **Insert** new books into the library
- 🔍 **Search** for books by title
- ✏️ **Update** existing book information
- ❌ **Delete** book entries
- 📊 **Sort** books based on title

This project is designed to demonstrate core Java skills, including GUI development, database integration, and CRUD operations using a clean and user-friendly interface.
